### What I learned

Box shadow is a property I have yet to used and I wanted to create something realistic.

```css
box-shadow: inset 0 -3em 3em rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 0 0 2px rgb(255, 255, 255),
    0.3em 0.3em 1em rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
```

### Continued development

My next focus is to continue tackling HTML and CSS. As it would make my practices easier. I am currently learn JS and after I will tackle projects with JS.


### Useful resources

- [FLEXBOX Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing guide which reminded me the flexbox properties. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
